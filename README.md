# distcc-exploit-python

This Python script is ported from a [Metasploit module](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/unix/misc/distcc_exec) (/unix/misc/distcc_exec). It exploits a [remote code execution vulnerability](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2004-2687) in the distcc, a distributed compiler.

I ported it mainly as a learning project. What I learned:

* Understanding remote exploits
* Practice Python scripting
* Using Wireshark to examine the packets sent by the exploit in order to debug my Python script 

This script might be helpful for OSCP as Metasploit usage is restricted.

**Usage**

`./distcc_exploit <ip> <port>`

NOTE: Replace the payload in the script.

**How to check for this vulnerability**

Nmap:

`nmap -p <port> <ip> --script distcc-cve2004-2687`

https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/distcc-cve2004-2687.html

Metasploit:

`msf5 exploit(unix/misc/distcc_exec) > check`
